# Weather-App-CustomTkinter
This is a Weather App written entirely in Python. This GUI application fetches live weather updates from www.openweatherapi.com for any city across the globe on a button click.</br>
While coding the UI, I am heavily relying on `CustomTkinter` library because `Tkinter` is notorious for bad UI. An innovative feature of `CustomTkinter` is that you can choose dark theme before coding and this has highly excited me as a designer who is obsessed with the same.</br>
Development is in progress and the app will be fully functional soon.</br>
Future scopes include predicting AQI and Rainfall using Machine Learning.
